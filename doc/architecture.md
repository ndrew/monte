## Front-end

Front-end uses common ui elements such as list of items, table and so on. Each ui element is defined by a config(hash map actually) with all data and listeners/handler needed, so messing up with css classes and similar crap will be written only once. 

In future ui defining may be refined to a dsl with macro-magic.
